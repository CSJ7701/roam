#+title: Transient Response
#+filetags: :Controls:

Transient response can be fast or slow, which can directly affect the result of the system.

In an elevator, a slow transient response can make passengers impatient, but an excessively fast response can injure them.

Many systems cannot handle transient response that is too fast, like a computer. There is a maximum read/write speed that a computer can handle and if you exceed this limit, the best case scenario is lost data.
