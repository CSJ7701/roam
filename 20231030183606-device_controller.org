#+title: Device Controller
#+filetags: :OS:

Device controllers are a component of an operating system, which are in charge of helping the rest of the OS communicate with various connected devices, like a USB device, an Audio Device, a Disk Drive, etc.
Each controller is assigned to a specific /type/ of device, but can have multiple devices of that type connected.
Typically, there is a [[id:0814df67-98bd-481f-af39-c53267082764][Device Driver]] assigned to each controller that acts as a sort of [[id:920e163f-b226-4817-8c7b-579de7b382d9][API]].

These controllers use a [[id:c19b8f34-8fb2-443e-804c-d60235741185][Bus]] to communicate with the central system.
