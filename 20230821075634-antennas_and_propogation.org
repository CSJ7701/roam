[[id:31df971c-3f7c-473f-b78a-4590b93fa8cf][Antennas]]

One of the primary objectives of this class is getting from point A to point B while dealing with:
- Obstructions
- Curve of the Earth
- Non line of sight
- Interference

* Basic Equations

$c = f\lambda$
Speed = frequency*wavelength

$P_{Out} = P_{In} * Gain$

Antenna Size, length must be greater than 1/10 of the wavelength.
Most effective at 1/2 or 1/3 the wavelength.

Curve of the earth is ~30 miles. Waves typically travel line of sight.
Can be deflected via /Skywave propogation/ (propogate via the ionosphere), /Groundwave propogation/ (travel in the troposphere or near the ground).

Signals less than 15 MHz refract off the ionospheres F-layer.

Max Usable Frequency (MUF) - maximum frequency in which signals refract off the F layer.

Typically, below 1-3 MHz, signals travel around the Earth's curve following the Norton Surface wave.
