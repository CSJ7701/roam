#+title: API
#+filetags: :OS:

A collection of functions that a developer can use to do certain things. These functions must be made available by a certain program. In general, API's are relatively ambiguous in terms of what they /actually/ are - any time an app or program makes a function available as an endpoint for a user or other program to use, this is considered an API. 

These functions, in operating systems, are typically provided by [[id:72f05190-574c-4084-a9f1-64931e4be103][Libraries]].
