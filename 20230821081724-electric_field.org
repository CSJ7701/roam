Electric Field, *E*
- An invisible force field produced by the presence of charged particles.

  $E = \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon d^{2}}(\frac{V}{m})$

  Where $\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{r}\varepsilon_{o}$
  $\varepsilon_r = 1$(air)
  $\varepsilon_o = 8.85*10^{-12}$
  $q = 1.6*10^{-19}C$ (Single Charge)
  $d = R =$ Distance
  $q =$ Charge in Coulombs

  Electric Fields can also be produced by a changing magnetic field (induced)

  $\int_{C} E \cdot dl = -\frac{d}{dt}\int_{S}B\cdot da$

** TLDR
Charges or potential difference produces an electric field, but a time varying magnetic field can also create an electric field.
