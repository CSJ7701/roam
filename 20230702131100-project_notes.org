#+title: Project Notes
#+filetags: :Roam:Permanent:

Notes intended to help organize work on a single project.

This is where TODOs would be stored
(This is also where I would use the systemcrafters function to add todos to my agenda based on file tag)

Project notes are meant to be kept for the lifetime of a project, then either archived or discarded.
I should look into how archiving works within Org Roam

- According to systemcrafters, in order to archive project notes I could filter out completed projects from the node list using a custom function.
