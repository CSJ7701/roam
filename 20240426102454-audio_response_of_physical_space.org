#+title: Audio Response of Physical Space
#+filetags: :DSP:

Reverb - ambience/echoe

Occurs because of:
- material composition (physical space)
- Geometry
- Position


Sound waves reflect or diffract off of physical materials in a space. Can affect the time that it takes for specific portions of an audio signal to return to a listener.

Can apply artificial reverb to a signal to simulate echoes or a physical space.

Can measure a space's impulse response using an 'impulse' (gunshot, baloon popping)
Can also use a Sine Sweep, which has a higher signal to noise ratio, but is more sensitive and more difficult to implement because of equipment.
