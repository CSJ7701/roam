=IF P THEN Q=
- p \implies q

If hypothesis is true and conclusion is true, then TRUE.
if hypothesis is false and conclusion is true, then TRUE
If hypothesis is false and conclusion is false, then TRUE
If hypothesis is true and conclusion is false, then FALSE

Only way for an implication to be false is for a true hypothesis to lead to a false conclusion.
