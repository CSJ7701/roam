#+title: Transfer Functions of Rotational Mechanical Systems
#+filetags: :Controls:

We handle these systems similar to how we approached [[id:d4252113-bf9d-48c9-a063-4180e8e5e8bf][Transfer Functions of Translational Mechanical Systems]].
In this case however, we replace force with torque and translational displacement with angular displacement.

We use variables /K/, /D/, and /J/ to represent spring constant, coefficient of viscous friction, and moment of inertia.
Writing the equations for these systems is much the same as for translational, except that we use torques instead of forces.
We find these torques with superposition; rotating a body while holding all other points still.
