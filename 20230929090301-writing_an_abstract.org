#+title: Writing an Abstract


*What did we do?*
- one sentence description to summarize lab/project/etc
=The purpose of this lab (entitleed a study of real world op-amps) is to learn about real world operationa amplifier characteristics, as compared to ideal operational amplifier assumptions=

- Diving into more detail
  =Here we present numerous measurements conducted on the 741 op amp, using laboratory equipment, matlab, and multisim.=

- What did we examine
=More specifically, we examined slew rate, gain bandwidth product, input bias current, open loop output impedance, etc for inverting amplifier configurations=

=We show that with reference to slew rate, output product and something impedance the ___ behaves exactly like an idela op amp, provided that the input signal frequency and amplitude are well within the gain bandwidth product and slew rate limitations for the device.=

- What did we find out?
=SCHTUFF=

=Finally, we predicted theoretical open and closed loop magnitude response plots, measurements, and multisim, and we highlight that lab measurements and simulation are consistant with the predicted theory=

Generic formula:
- General summary
- Slightly more specific
- What we looked for and what we used
- What we found
- What that means


Dont use too much detail, but summarize what we found.
Purpose is to look at findings from a high level, and give information to someone who might potentially want more information about what we did.
