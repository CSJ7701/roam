#+title: Conditional Probability
#+filetags: :ProbTheory:

This reduces the set that we are looking at.

The number of something given that something else.

$P(Something|Something Else)$

We can say that the probability of B given A is the same as:

$$\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)}$$

We can derive a multiplication rule:
$$P(A\cap B) =  P(B|A)P(A)$$
OR: $$P(A\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$$
