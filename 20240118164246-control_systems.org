Control Systems consist of [[id:e2fc3bd3-f6e3-4241-a2f6-cc9e8d441bac][Subsystems]] and [[id:1ca741d9-998e-466e-8811-ba5ba48a1f2e][Processes]] assembled in order to produce an /output/ and /performance/, given a specific /input/.

There are 2 general ways to measure a control system's performance:
[[id:b5dd9b48-bffe-4026-a69b-e8bb8a14fd0d][Transient Response]] and [[id:7a4483a8-cea7-4122-bc77-0a4755419f23][Steady-State Error]]

We build control systems for 4 main reasons:
- Power amplification
- Remote control
- Input form convenience
- Disturbance compensation


Example:

In a temperature control system, the input is a /position/ on thermostat. The output is /heat/.

Typically, output will be things such as temperature, position, velocity, voltage, current, or frequency.
A system must be able to control these variables accurately even through a disturbance.
If wind shifts an antenna or noise enters the antenna from an external system, the antenna must be able to detect the disturbance and correct for it.

Control systems can be configured in several different ways, but two of the most common are [[id:1817e95e-ce53-4090-a2a3-0663af0ce70d][Open Loop]] and [[id:11d38775-cc5d-490c-aaa3-f36f488e426e][Closed Loop]].

Control systems are /dynamic/. They respond to an input by undergoing [[id:b5dd9b48-bffe-4026-a69b-e8bb8a14fd0d][Transient Response]], before reaching a [[id:592f54a4-3fa6-454a-88e0-7a736edcce25][Steady-State Response]] that generally resembles the input (with the difference between the two being [[id:7a4483a8-cea7-4122-bc77-0a4755419f23][Steady-State Error]]). 
Another factor to consider is the systems [[id:6c95b3d1-294a-4be8-99e2-ad97af643fcd][Stability]]. 

In order to design effective control systems, we must follow a consistant [[id:7cb6bb72-92e2-4ecf-9757-4eb7124762d3][Design Process]].
