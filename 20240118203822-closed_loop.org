In a generic closed loop system, an [[id:9ba64c6f-6255-4a53-9ded-cde1f0a4392d][Output Transducer]] measures the output response and converts it to the form used by the controller.

E.G. if the controller uses electrical signals to operate valves of a temperature control system, the input position and output temperature are converted to electrical signals. The input position can be converted to a voltage by a potentiometer, a variable resistor, and the output temperature can be converted to a voltage by a thermistor, a device whose electrical resistance changes with temperature.

The first summing junction algebraically subtracts the signal from the input to the signal from the output. The result is generally known as the [[id:2ddf8d22-1278-461a-938c-03d142d309d7][Actuating Signal]].

When both [[id:4bb0c1a7-d32c-48a4-9fc4-c0174b1b961f][Input]] and [[id:9ba64c6f-6255-4a53-9ded-cde1f0a4392d][Output Transducer]] have unity gain (transducer outputs the same as the input) the [[id:2ddf8d22-1278-461a-938c-03d142d309d7][Actuating Signal]]s value is equal to the actual difference between the input and output, in which case the actuating signal is known as [[id:2ddf8d22-1278-461a-938c-03d142d309d7][Error]].

A closed loop system accounts for disturbances by measuring output response, feeding that through the feedback path, and comparing that response to the input at the summing junction.
If there is a difference, the system drives the plant (via the [[id:2ddf8d22-1278-461a-938c-03d142d309d7][Actuating Signal]]) to make a correction. If there is no difference, than the input remains the same and the system does not drive the plant.

Closed loop systems are, in general, less sensitive to noise/[[id:267097e9-97bf-45df-901b-efa69b840c5e][Disturbances]] and changes in the environment, and are almost always more accurate.
[[id:b5dd9b48-bffe-4026-a69b-e8bb8a14fd0d][Transient Response]] and [[id:7a4483a8-cea7-4122-bc77-0a4755419f23][Steady-State Error]] can be controlled more conveniently and with greater flexibility simply by modifying the gain. We refer to this adjustment as [[id:bcc70c7d-d37f-4ead-9796-23237b9bba42][Compensating]] and the hardware as the [[id:0b90dd1d-5eb8-49a1-a1a4-31aa05ada661][Compensator]].
These systems are, however, more complex and expensive. There is a trade-off between the simplicity and low-cost of an open loop system, and the accuracy and higher cost of a closed loop system.
