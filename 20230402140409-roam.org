* Basics

Create nodes. Nodes can be linked with links.
Basic link syntax =[[id:"Node ID Number"]["Display Text"]]=
These are basic [[id:9d5d89cc-4f44-45a4-86a4-7dc57f50a7ae][Emacs]] links, but work off the idea of note id's.
Creating links does more than let you jump around, it creates associations (learn more about what specifically it does.)
