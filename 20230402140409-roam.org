* Basics

Create nodes. Nodes can be linked with links.
Basic link syntax =[[id:"Node ID Number"]["Display Text"]]=
These are basic [[id:9d5d89cc-4f44-45a4-86a4-7dc57f50a7ae][Emacs]] links, but work off the idea of note id's.
Creating links does more than let you jump around, it creates associations (learn more about what specifically it does.)

Works off the basic concept of [[id:c66ffc4b-d29c-4a39-878a-06be12f7ea30][Zettelkasten]].
Make use of [[id:38bf58c7-d45d-452b-861a-5f214ce05aac][Permanent Notes]], [[id:31f392ad-66cf-44dd-8b76-6fef65f4aaa6][Project Notes]], and especially [[id:1092c402-14a5-406e-bb6d-e5f77d0c6b9d][Fleeting Notes]].
