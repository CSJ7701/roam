Generic open loop systems begin with a subsystem called an [[id:4bb0c1a7-d32c-48a4-9fc4-c0174b1b961f][Input Transducer]]. These convert the form of the input so that they can be used by the [[id:680899f0-4cdf-48fe-b2ec-f1cfb55985e7][Controller]]. The controller drives a [[id:1ca741d9-998e-466e-8811-ba5ba48a1f2e][Process]].

The input is sometimes known as the reference, while the output can be called the controlled variable.
Other signals, like [[id:267097e9-97bf-45df-901b-efa69b840c5e][Disturbances]], are shown added to the controller and process outputs with /summing junctions/, which produce the algebraic sum of their input signals.

The distinguishing charateristic of open-loop systems is that they are not able to compensate for any disturbances.
Any additive input at the first summing junction in the figure above will drive the process along with the initial input, corrupting the output.
Inputs or disturbances that occur after the process will corrupt the output as well, shown at the second summing junction in the diagram.

Open loop systems do not correct for disturbances at all, and are commanded simply by their input.
