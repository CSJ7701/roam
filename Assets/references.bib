  abstract = {Electronic Music Distribution (EMD) is in demand of robust, automatically extracted music descriptors. We introduce a timbral similarity measures for comparing music titles. This measure is based on a Gaussian model of cepstrum coefficients. We describe the timbre extractor and the corresponding timbral similarity relation. We describe experiments in assessing the quality of the similarity relation, and show that the measure is able to yield interesting similarity relations, in particular when used in conjunction with other similarity relations. We illustrate the use of the descriptor in several EMD applications developed in the context of the Cuidado European project.},

  abstract = {Beat tracking -- i.e. deriving from a music audio signal a sequence of beat instants that might correspond to when a human listener would tap his foot -- involves satisfying two constraints: On the one hand, the selected instants should generally correspond to moments in the audio where a beat is indicated, for instance by the onset of a note played by one of the instruments. On the other hand, the set of beats should reflect a locally-constant inter-beat-interval, since it is this regular spacing between beat times that defines musical rhythm. These dual constraints map neatly onto the two constraints optimized in dynamic programming, the local match, and the transition cost. We describe a beat tracking system which first estimates a global tempo, uses this tempo to construct a transition cost function, then uses dynamic programming to find the best-scoring set of beat times that reflect the tempo as well as corresponding to moments of high `onset strength' in a function derived from the audio. This very simple and computationally efficient procedure is shown to perform well on the MIREX-06 beat tracking training data, achieving an average beat accuracy of just under 60\% on the development data. We also examine the impact of the assumption of a fixed target tempo, and show that the system is typically able to track tempo changes in a range of {\textpm}10\% of the target tempo.},

  abstract = {Users are able to access millions of songs through music streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, and Deezer. Access to such large catalogs, created a need for relevant song recommendations. However, user preferences are highly subjective in nature and change according to context (e.g., music that is suitable in the morning is not as suitable in the evening). Moreover, the music one user may prefer in a given context may be different from what another user prefers in the same context (i.e., what is considered good morning music differs across users). Accurately representing these preferences is essential to creating accurate and effective song recommendations. User preferences for songs can be based on high level audio features, such as tempo and valence. In this paper, we therefore propose a contextual re-ranking algorithm, based on audio feature representations of user preferences in specific contextual conditions. We evaluate the performance of our re-ranking algorithm using the \#NowPlaying-RS dataset, which exists of user listening events crawled from Twitter and is enriched with song audio features. We compare a global (context for all users) and personalized (context for each user) model based on these audio features. The global model creates an audio feature representation of each contextual condition based on the preferences of all users. Unlike the global model, the personalized model creates user-specific audio feature representations of contextual conditions, and is measured across 333 distinct users. We show that the personalized model outperforms the global model when evaluated using the precision and mean average precision metrics.},

However, music signals possess specific acoustic and structural characteristics that distinguish them from spoken language or other nonmusical signals. This paper provides an overview of some signal analysis techniques that specifically address musical dimensions such as melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. We will examine how particular characteristics of music signals impact and determine these techniques, and we highlight a number of novel music analysis and retrieval tasks that such processing makes possible. Our goal is to demonstrate that, to be successful, music audio signal processing techniques must be informed by a deep and thorough insight into the nature of music itself.},

  abstract = {This thesis aims at developing techniques which support users in accessing and discovering music. The main part consists of two chapters. Chapter 2 gives an introduction to computational models of music simi- larity. The combination of different approaches is optimized and the largest evaluation of music similarity measures published to date is presented. The best combination performs significantly better than the baseline approach in most of the evaluation categories. A particular effort is made to avoid overfitting. To cross-check the results from the evaluation based on genre classification a listening test is conducted. The test confirms that genre- based evaluations are suitable to efficiently evaluate large parameter spaces. Chapter 2 ends with recommendations on the use of similarity measures. Chapter 3 describes three applications of such similarity measures. The first application demonstrates how music collections can be organized and vi- sualized so that users can control the aspect of similarity they are interested in. The second application demonstrates how music collections can be orga- nized hierarchically into overlapping groups at the artist level. These groups are summarized using words from web pages associated with the respective artists. The third application demonstrates how playlists can be generated which require minimum user input.},
