#+title: Monolithic Structure vs Layered Approach
#+filetags: :OS:

The [[id:6192b5b0-e1c5-4812-91d1-14b4514a5ec3][Layered Approach]] is typically slower, since there are more "layers" and paths for functions and data to traverse. The [[id:3caa55fd-2427-4d65-b15b-a6b2f1e0105d][Monolithic Structure]] is faster since all the code is close to itself.

Layered is easier to debug, since the layers help us to know where errors happen and how to find the relevant information to fix such errors.

Layered approach is also easier to update, since you can update a solitary layer and its dependencies, rather than the entire glob of unorganized code.
