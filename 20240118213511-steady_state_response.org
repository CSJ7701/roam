#+title: Steady-State Response
#+filetags: :Controls:


Steady State Response refers to the condition that the system is in once the transients have decayed to zero.
Once the system comes to a rest, where is it?

E.G. once the elevator stops moving, is it on the correct floor? Is it close enough to level for the passengers to get out?

We are primarily concerned with the accuracy of the steady state response, and how close it is to the input or desired result.
