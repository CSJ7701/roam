Standing Orders
- 4 things to do before assuming watch
- Reasons to call CO for contact reporting ##
- Calling the CO for weather ##
- Any other reasons (Not including weather or contacts) ##

3 Min Rule
D(yds)/100=S(kts)
S(kts)*100=D(yds)

6 Min Rule
D(nm)*10=S(kts)
S(kts)/10=D(nm)

Radar
- Information you can get from relative vectors
  (CPA, TCPA, etc)
- Getting Aspect from true vectors
- Risk of Collision (traffic, maneuverability for both boats, speed, course)


Situations
- Dayshapes
- Hierarchy, Crossing, Head On, Overtaking
- Proper actions (Give-way vs. Stand On)
- Narrow Channels
- Seperation Schemes


| Crossing                  | Head on              | Hierarchy       | Overtaking                                        |
| Two PDV                   | Two PDV              | Different Types | Two Vessels (any type)                            |
| ROC                       | ROC                  | ROC             | ROC                                               |
| In-Sight                  | In-Sight             | In-sight        | In-Sight                                          |
| Not Head on or overtaking | Reciprocal or nearly | Not Overtaking  | One vessel Overtaking (22.5 degrees abaft of beam |

N - not under command
R - RAM
C - constrained by draft
F - fishing/trawling
S - sailing
P - PDV
S - seaplanes
W - WIG's

Know Light Angles

 
Components of GPS
- Space
- Control
- User


4 satellites to a fix


GPS Limitations


ENAV
- ENC
- DNC
- RNC
- Comm. Vector
- Comm. Raster


ECDIS sensor inputs
 - GPS
 - AIS
 - Fathometer
 - Anemometer
 - Gyro
 - Radar
 - Speed Log


 SAR

 Drifting Vs Presision
- Drifting - expanding square and sector search
- Precision - 


Different parts of a pattern
- Will have to draw and label a search pattern (Probably parallel, will need 7 different labels)


How we choose what patterns to use
- Search Area Size
- Datum Accuracy
- Conditions
- Size of object

ICS Roles (SMC, OSC, ETC)
