Standing Orders
- 4 things to do before assuming watch
  - Ensure all watchstanders are rested
  - Study Charts. plot a fix
  - Confirm weather
  - Read and initial night orders
  - Confirm guarded radio frequencies.
  - Verify ships course and speed
  - Assess risk of collision with all visual and RADAR contacts
- Reasons to call CO for contact reporting
  - Contacts first detected visually/on RADAR at a distance of less than 4 NM
  - Contacts with a CPA less than 2 NM
- Calling the CO for weather
  - Change in wind direction - 20 degrees or more in an hour
  - change in wind velocity - 10kts or more in  an hour
  - Change in barometric pressure or 0.03 inches or more in an hour
  - visibility less than 2 NM
- Any other reasons (Not including weather or contacts)
  - Uncorrelated sound signal from a vessel forward of beam in restricted vis
  - when further than 0.5 NM from the trackline
  - when in doubt of ships position or safety
  - To report equipment casualty
  - To report personnel injury or casualty
  - If unsure of orders to watch
  - if there is any reason you cannot relieve the watch
  - if you are overwhelmed.

3 Min Rule
D(yds)/100=S(kts)
S(kts)*100=D(yds)

6 Min Rule
D(nm)*10=S(kts)
S(kts)/10=D(nm)

Radar
- Information you can get from relative vectors
  (CPA, TCPA, etc)
- Getting Aspect from true vectors
- Risk of Collision (traffic, maneuverability for both boats, speed, course)


Situations
- Dayshapes
- Hierarchy, Crossing, Head On, Overtaking
- Proper actions (Give-way vs. Stand On)
- Narrow Channels
- Seperation Schemes


| Crossing                  | Head on              | Hierarchy       | Overtaking                                        |
| Two PDV                   | Two PDV              | Different Types | Two Vessels (any type)                            |
| ROC                       | ROC                  | ROC             | ROC                                               |
| In-Sight                  | In-Sight             | In-sight        | In-Sight                                          |
| Not Head on or overtaking | Reciprocal or nearly | Not Overtaking  | One vessel Overtaking (22.5 degrees abaft of beam |

N - not under command
R - RAM
C - constrained by draft
F - fishing/trawling
S - sailing
P - PDV
S - seaplanes
W - WIG's

Know Light Angles
- Mast head light is 225
- Stern Light is 360-225 = 135
- Side lights are 1/2*225 = 112.5

 
Components of GPS
- Space
- Control
- User


4 satellites to a fix


GPS Limitations
- Signal blockage
- Multipath interference
- Spoofing/Jamming
- Solar Storms
- Maintenance or Maneuvers creating coverage gaps


ENAV
- ENC
- DNC
- RNC
- Comm. Vector
- Comm. Raster

Raster - photograph of a paper chart
Vector - electronic representation with digital 'layers'


ECDIS sensor inputs
 - GPS
 - AIS
 - Fathometer
 - Anemometer
 - Gyro
 - Radar
 - Speed Log


 SAR

SAR objectives
- Minimize loss of life, injury, and property; minimize damage to maritime environment
- Minimize crew risk during operations
- Optimize resource usage
- Maintain a world leadership position in SAR
 
 Drifting Vs Presision
- Drifting - expanding square and sector search
- Precision - parallel search, creeping search, trackline search


Different parts of a pattern
- Will have to draw and label a search pattern (Probably parallel, will need 7 different labels)
  - Commence Search Point
  - SRU Course
  - Track Spacing
  - Search Legs
  - Cross Legs
  - Sweep Width
  - Search Endpoint


How we choose what patterns to use
- Search Area Size
- Datum Accuracy
- Conditions
- Size of object


Trackline - route is known. Rapid track coverage
Parallel - longer legs, fewer turns. Large search areas where initial positions is approximately known. Uniform Coverage
Creeping Line - like parallel. Shorter legs, more turns. Creep is along major axis. Used to cover one end of a search area where the object is more likely.
Sector - reasonable certainty about datum. high coverage in immediate vicinity (covers same area multiple times / overlap).
Expanding Square - small area, some doubt about distress position. More uniform coverage than sector, can expand.

Initial Questions
- Position
- Number of persons
- nature of distress
- Description
- Adequate PFD's?

ICS Roles (SMC, OSC, ETC)
