Mediums absorb the signal. This is a decrease in amplitude. 
This is how Shielding works.

If a wave travels in a conductive medium (e.g. seawater), the waves energy is absorbed by the medium.

$x(x,t) = A cos[ ] \rightarrow Ae^{-\alpha x}cos[ ]$

A - contant attenuation
$Ae^{-\alpha x}$ - attenuation varies with distance.

$\alpha$ - attenuation constant. Function of the material and the frequency.

Conductors absorb EM signals easily - this is why we shield electronic systems from external interference using aluminum or copper foil.
Shielding:
A. reduces susceptibility to external interfrence
B. minimizes radiation of the signal (spying)
