#+title: Transfer Functions of Electromechanical Systems
#+filetags: :Controls:

Electromechanical systems are those that take electrical input and transform them into mechanical impulse.
These typically include elements like motors, which yield a displacement output for voltage input.
The figure below shows the schematic for a motor.

The voltage carrying armature rotates in a magnetic field, which means that the voltage is proportional to the speed.
$v_{b}(t)=K_{b}\frac{d\Theta_{m}(t)}{dt}$
$v_b$ is the electromotive force, or back emf.
K is a constant known as the back emf constant
The fraction represents omega, or the angular velocity of the motor.
