Transmitter Signal = $x_{T_{x}}(t) = A cos(\omega t)$
This signal has split into 2 pieces (multipath).
The direct signal (signal 1) has a delay of 45, and the reflected has a delay of 225 degrees.
$\therefore$ the received signal is $y(t) = A cos(\omega t-45\degree) + A cos (\omega t -225\degree) = 0$
In this case, the signal completely destroyed itself.

This situation demonstrated [[id:bccc6e06-5756-431f-9445-1e700720be42][Destructive Interference]], but we can also create a system where the delays create [[id:1d77fc2b-fda4-4ffe-b510-d3e516d60993][Constructive Interference]].

E.G. if the direct and reflected signals had a phase of 360 and 720 degrees respectively, the received signal would be:

$y(t) = A cos (\omega t -360) + A cos (\omega t-720) = 2A cos (\omega t)$
*Note* - phase and time delay are not the same.

$z(t) = A cos (2\pi ft -\phi) = A cos[2\pi f(t-t_{d})] = A cos[2\pi ft-2\pi ft_{d}]
$t_{d} = \text{Time Delay}$
$\therefore \phi = 2\pi ft_{d}$

*Note* -  Distance = Rate*Time $\rightarrow t_{d} = d/c$
