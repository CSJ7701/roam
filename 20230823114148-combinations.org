Order Does not matter

Ex - 5 math classes
How many ways can we select 2 to take?
If number mattered -> $\frac{5!}{3!} = 20$
$2!$ ways to order them
num of combinations  = $\frac{\frac{5!}{3!}}{2!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!}$
Theorem:
num of combinations of n distinct  items taken r at a time
$\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!} = \binom{n}{r}$

*Positioning n items in k subsets*
Missed this one

$5+5 = 10 + 0 @ 1-\dot$
$\text{this is a test} 5+5=10$
