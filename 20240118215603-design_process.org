* Step 1
*Determine a physical system and specifications from the requirements*

* Step 2
*Draw a functional Block Diagram*

* Step 3
*Transform the physical system into a schematic*

* Step 4
*Use the schematic to obtain a block diagram, signal-flow diagram, or state-space representation.*

* Step 5
*If multiple blocks, reduce diagram to a single block or [[id:11d38775-cc5d-490c-aaa3-f36f488e426e][Closed Loop]] system*

* Step 6
*Analyze, design, and test to see that requirements and specifications are met*
