Converse of an implication:
The converse of =If p then q= is =If q then p=.

This is useful with [[id:79dc34a1-9050-4695-909b-559e59debbbc][Double Implication]], which states that both an implication and its converse must be true.

Ex. 1
Converse of:
- =If 4 is even, then 2 is an even number= - =If 2 is an even number, then 4 is even=
- =Whenever a real number is positive, its square root is positive= - =Whenever a numbers square root is positive, the number is positive=
  We can rewrite this as an if then statement: =If a real number is positive, its square root is positive= - =If a numbers square root is positive, the number is positive=
