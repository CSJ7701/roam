#+title: Shared Memory
#+filetags: :OS:

Shared Memory operates using a singular data storage space. Processes use the same space to write memory, and on larger scales memory from other processes can be overwritten.

This is much faster, but it is risky since the processes don't know what they should overwrite and what they shouldn't.

One example is something known as a =Data Race=.
These are situations where a given program may asynchronously execute two functions, =print(x)= and =print(x++)=
We don't know which one of these functions will execute first - so we can't guaruntee which value will print.
