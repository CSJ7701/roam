  Not sure EWW bar is what I'm looking for, might be better to stick to waybar but with entries that activate eww widgets

  No longer using the tab functionality. Need to revisit later and either discontinue this task or consider using tabs again.
:END:
Should let me limit my tab layout to directly specified.
I want Startpage tab, Roam tab, and general (plus any others I decide to add)

** TODO Make function - insert tag from list.
Make a list of existing tags, insert one from list. If tag I want doesn't exist I can type it and insert.
Should be similar to my old search by tags function.

** NEXT Fix Org Capture Templates
Biggest thing I know I'm missing is a way to capture a task to a project. That should let me select a project file (or alternately, run a new "create project" function(?) then capture to that project.

  No longer using tab functionality. May revisit tabs in the future, but for now not relevant.
:END:
There are a few things I'm missing, as i use the setup I'll find them.
First one I can think of is a more robust switching command
