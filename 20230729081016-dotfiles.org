** DEFER Change Bar from Waybar to EWW 
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DEFER"      from "INBOX"      [2023-06-23 Fri 19:20] \\
  Not sure EWW bar is what I'm looking for, might be better to stick to waybar but with entries that activate eww widgets

** NEXT Make a "find file in XXX tab" function
Should let me limit my tab layout to directly specified.
I want Startpage tab, Roam tab, and general (plus any others I decide to add)

** TODO Make function - insert tag from list.
Make a list of existing tags, insert one from list. If tag I want doesn't exist I can type it and insert.
Should be similar to my old search by tags function.

** NEXT Start optimizing tab functions
There are a few things I'm missing, as i use the setup I'll find them.
First one I can think of is a more robust switching command
