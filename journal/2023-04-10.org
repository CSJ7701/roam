The next few weeks are going to suck. I don't honestly know how I'm going to do it...
I've got 2 exams this week, another next week, and the SST exam 3 weeks from now; my DCCS project is due next week, and among all of that I need to pass my ACDO board and study for SST. I'm doing my best and I'm worried it's not enough. I procastinate too much - I've sort of made this computer my escape, which is an issue. I need to buckle down, but I'm so burnt out that I don't really know how... I just want this to be over at this point. Anyway, I'm still figuring out how to use this thing as a journal, but I feel like I'm finally managing to get my workflow together at least.
