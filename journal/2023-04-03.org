This weekend wasn't as productive as I would have liked. I spent all Saturday playing video games and watching netflix, which was fun, but not particularly useful.

I need to figure out a better workflow for Org Roam. I want to use it more - I think it could be useful, but I need to sit down and learn it, which I just don't have time for.
