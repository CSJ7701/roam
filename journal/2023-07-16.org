* Daily Log
The first day of Swab Summer. Honestly it's a little surreal. I vividly remember being a swab 2 years ago, and it sounds insane even thinking that that was 2 years ago already. Forrest said this would come naturally, and he was right. I was terrified all day leading up to the change of command, but once it came I just sort of fell into the mindset. I haven't really gotten a feel for the swabs yet. They all seem decent to me, but supposedly there are a few problems in there. We'll see. I'm not that tired yet, but if I keep up the sleep schedule that it looks like I'll have to, then I'll definitely be tired very soon. 
** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
