* Daily Log
We had range week this week - it's been pretty slow. We shot; I didn't do very well. I'm not really sure how to go about this - I want to start journaling better, but I don't really know how. Maybe the prompts are the answer? I honestly don't feel as though I'm getting much from this... but I don't know how to make it better. 
** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
