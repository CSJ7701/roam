* Daily Log
Spent all of today motoring, most of it through fog. Yesterday was really foggy too, but I was standin on the bow for lookout, so it seemd to go by faster. Today I was at the Helm, and everything seemed to drag on. So far the trip has been really fun. I enjoy being on the boat, sailing is a blast and we're all having a good time.  At the same time, I can feel myself slowlylosing patience. I can tell that CDR is somewhat irritated with the trip in general (justifiably, this is his fourth sortie) but he seems to be taking that out on us at times. Everyone else on the boat has been great, but Genevieve freaking Brewer chooses to act like a damn child - spoiled, pretentious, and bratty. Hopefully I can make it through this trip without absolutely losing my mind on someone.
