* Daily Log
I had a great day today. We actually sailed today, which was fun. The sea was pretty rough though, and the wind was steady on about 20 knots, gusting up to 30 ish. That meant that pretty much everyone except me and luke got seasick (thank God for Dramamine). Needless to say, I think I was the only one who actually enjoyed today. Riding the waves was a blast, and even though it took us a long ass time, I really enjoyed being able to really sail in strong winds. It didn't help that CDR decided to play his music (Irish music) the whole time - everyone except me and maybe Cohen thought the music was really stupid.
