* Daily Log
I was the Navigator today, coming into Nantucket. I absolutely loved it there. The town was gorgeous, cobblestone streets and cute houses. We ended up getting seperated from the larger group since I didn't want to feel like going to the beach, so Joe and I  went to get seafood. I had Pork and Octupus, which ended up being amazing. Walked around with a larger group after that and ended up having a great time. 
** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
