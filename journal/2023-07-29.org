* Daily Log
The swabs come back tomorrow. Not really excited for that. I feel as though most of them don't really want to be here. I genuinely don't understand why most of them don't seem to want to show effort... When I came here, I may not have been the best swab, but I know I demonstrated enough effort to make it clear that I wanted to be here. 
** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
