* Daily Log
Today was the first day of CAP week. Ending swab summer is weird - Im glad it's over (it was a ton of work and I was exhausted all the time) but at the same time it was so fun and definitely rewarding. I finished my [[id:57f488c1-8167-4b2c-aa54-fa0e044926ae][Cadre Summer Bullets]] today - I think they were decent. Im honestly not sure how "good" of a cadre I was. I think I did a decent job making them feel comfortable at the academy, but Im not sure I did as good of a job actually teaching them. IDK, well see. Either way Im glad its over and Im excited for a new semester.
