* 11:24 AM: Weekly recap
Finished [[id:931e43fe-6dcc-4d9c-9d16-0ea69410878f][MCTC]] yesterday. We had an informal little graduation, then we put our aguilettes on our trops.
This honestly feels a little surreal. We're finally cadre - I don't feel ready at all. In 4-5 weeks I'm going to be responsible for the lives of ~30 actual people - they're going to look to me for answers and I'm not sure that I'll have them. All this training over the past week or so; learning how to lead and what a good leader is; I'm not 100% sure that's me... I want to do my best, but I don't know yet if that's something that i'll be able to do well or at all. I guess we'll see - I'm really nervous.
