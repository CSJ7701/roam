* Daily Log
We had a senator come into the wing area and talk to the swabs today. He basically said what we've been saying, and the main reason for him being there was PR, but it was still interesting. It was nice to see someone else talk about the fact that we have to work, and push to make sure we earn our spot here. I need to work on remembering that I chose to be here, and it will all be worth it eventually. 
** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
