* 01:47 PM: MCTC Day 2
The school year's over. I somehow passed SST - managed to score a 63 on the final and bump my total grade up to an 80.
This was easily the most challenging year of my life - I've never had to work harder than I did this year.
This is the second day of MCTC. We had ROTR last week (I passed) and the PFE this Sunday (Also passed).
The Cape May CC's were here from Sunday to Monday. That was really challenging, but a ton of fun.
Now we're on to MCTC, which has been simultaneously really informational but also pretty boring and frustrating.
