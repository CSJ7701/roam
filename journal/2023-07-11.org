* Daily Log
Today was rough. My patience for the trip is entirely gone, and if I have to deal with Genevieve and her complete idiocy any longer than I have to, I might actually lose it. I basically sat in silence the whole time, which I really enjoyedf, but I kept getting CDR asking me if I was ok, which was a little irritating. All in all not a great day, but not really for any particular reason. 
** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
