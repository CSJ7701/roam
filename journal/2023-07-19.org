* Daily Log
Yesterday was rough. We had our first actual ICE session, and I think I've figured out that I have to take a step back sometimes. I did no good at the ICE session yesterday, and I could have skipped it entirely. The same is true for other evolutions. I need to make sure that I'm pacing myself for when I'm needed, so that I'm not burnt out when everyone else needs me to do something.
I also want to re-evaluate what type of cadre I want to be. So far I've been like magnum, very loud, but ofcusing on minue details of brace. I think I want to quieten a little, and focus on teaching and using dissapointment instead of anger. 

** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
