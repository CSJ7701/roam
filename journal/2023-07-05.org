* Daily Log
It's the first full day of Coastal Sail. We departed around 1100 this morning and sailed until about 1300. It seems pretty fun so far, the days are gonna be long and hot, but it seems as though theyll go fast. Today was pretty uneventful overall, more to report tomorrow. 
** What went well?
We got underway smoothly, seemed to all be ready for a good week.
** What didn't?

** What can I change?
