* Daily Log
This is the last day before I become an official Cadre.
I'm really nervous, but I'so really excited.
I feel as though everything this summer has lead up to this point, from [[id:931e43fe-6dcc-4d9c-9d16-0ea69410878f][MCTC]] to [[id:21c174c9-aa20-4cc4-9f11-e452d7b31f38][CGCYBER]] to everything else we've done.
I really hope I do well over these next few weeks, and I want to make sure that I focus on being a symbol for these kids.
I want to ensure that when they look at me during the school year, they still see a Cadre, and not the regular 2nd class behavior that I've been used to these last few years. 
** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
