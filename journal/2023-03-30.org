* 08:38 AM: Good start to the day
Made myself a cup of tea - I need to do that more often.
I really should ask Caleb to make sure I go to church this weekend (except that I say that and won't actually do it). This is going to be a bit of a shift for me, starting to use a journal, and an online one at that - I want to find a way to sync between computers that isn't github (since github is public). Work on that.
