* Daily Log
I was watch captain today, which went pretty well. Rough start to the day - our toilet exploded on us and CDR had to spend almost 2 hours fixing it. We motored the whole way to Hyannis and I drove us into port. Stressful, buta rewarding experience. We went out to dinner as a boat tonight (just the cadets). Ronnie had a huge margarita, so she was hilarious. Thats one of the first times I've felt like a normal college kid. It felt great to feel included and it felt as though I was actuallty a part of the group. My oscial battery ran out on the walk back, but I was able to enjoy a nice quiet walk. Hyannis seems like a really cute little town. Saw a video of Stephen Colbert today that I thought was really insightful - [[id:6bae3321-927a-415d-ab9b-2554a92809f4][Stephen Colbert Video]]
