* Daily Log
Trying to get more into daily journalling. I think I might start a 30 day prompt or something similar. My weekend has been relatively relaxed - went with Ian and Dan to the mall yesterday; spent way too much money on magic cards. I should probably learn to practice better self control with my money, but whatever. All in all a good end to the first week of swab summer. 

** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
