* Daily Log
** 1256 PM : We just finished T-Boats.
We got to ride on the Shuman, which has 2 screws. We rode out to the New London Light House, then back to NewLo to get some food from muddy waters. Of course I managed to spill tea all down the front of my uniform, so now I have to wash it... I want to focus on being less aggressive and imposing on my friends. I like that I have people I can screw around with, but I don't necessarily like how I act around them. I feel as though I'm more disrespecful and confrontational when I'm with them - not their fault, it's something I need to change. 
** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
