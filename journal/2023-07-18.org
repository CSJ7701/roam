* Daily Log
Third day of Swab Summer. My voice is completely gone - I need to pace myself a little better. I had my first drill practice yesterday - it did not go well. I was unprepared and disorganized. The whole thing was a little bit of a shit show.
Hopefully I'll do better in the future, but while I was taking the chit swabs to a training, I did get to have a good chat with Swab Marshall, who I think I like; he seems like a good kid. 
** What went well?

** What didn't?

** What can I change?
