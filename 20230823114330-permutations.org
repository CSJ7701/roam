*Permutations of n Objects*
Order matters without replacement

Ex - How many orderings/permutations of letters I, J, K, L, M are there?
$5! = 120$

Ex - How many ways can 3 people be assigned to 3 different duties?
$3! = 6$

*Permutations of n distinct items taken r at a time*
$r\le n$

Ex - num of permutations of 3 of the 5 letters: I, J, K, L, M?
$5*4*3 = 60$

Theorem
The num of permutations of n distinct objects taken r at a time:
$\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

*Permutations when some alike*
Ex - How many /distinct/ permutations of the letters in the word "Probability" are there?
Num of letters in probability = 11
_Didnt get all of this example_

Theorem
the num of distinguishable permutations of n objects of which $n_1$ are one of a kind, $n_2$ of another, $n_k$ of the kth kind.
$\frac{n!}{n_{1}!*n_{2}!*...*n_{k}!}$
