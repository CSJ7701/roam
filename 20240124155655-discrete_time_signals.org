Discrete Time Signal - x(n) - a function of an independent variable that is an integer.
discrete signals are not defined for non integer values of n.

It's important to recognize some [[id:7c00103b-9cfb-4e1f-9ced-3baee053f3d2][Common Discrete Time Signals]].
These play an integral role in our understanding and analysis of signals.

When working with DT signals, its important to understand the /type/ of signal we are working with.

* Power and Energy signals
We can find the [[id:9dfebd56-e574-4879-b925-4bfb8451036f][Energy and Power]] of a signal, which allows us to determine whether the signal is a power signal, an energy signal, or neither.

* Periodic Signals
