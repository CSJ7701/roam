#+title: Spherical Dispersion
#+filetags: :Antennas:

As distance increases, the wave disperses. Think about a flashlight - the beam is focused at a close distance, but further away the beam creates a larger circle. 

The remedy for this is to introduce a reflector.

$L_{Path} = \text{Path loss due to spherical dispersion}$
$L_{Spherical Dispersion} = (\frac{4l\pi}{\lambda})^2 = (\frac{4fl\pi}{c})^{2}$
$P_{Rx} = P_{Tx}*g_{Tx_{antenna}}*g_{Rx_{antenna}} / L_{Path}$
