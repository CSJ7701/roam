3 Layers - Vinyl Jacket on the outside, A shield/dialectric, then the inner conductor.

Coax is used for network or radio systems below 1GHz.
The shield allows it to be bent at sharp angles and placed in close proximity to metallic objects (unlike twin lead or twisted pair)

Coax is effectively just 2 conductors, whose resistances are a function of frequency, conductivity, permeability, permittivity, length, and cross-sectional area.
($\sigma_{c}$ - conductivity, $\mu_{c}$ - permeability, $\varepsilon_{c}$ - permittivity)

Since the dialectric is imperfect, it is also technically a conductor (its resistance is higher than conductance, but there exists some small amount of conductance).
This conductance is a function of frequency, conductivity, permeability, permittivity, length and cross-sectional area.

*Transmission Line Parameters:*

$a = \frac{\text{inner diameter}}{2}$
$b = \frac{\text{outer diameter}}{2}$
$R_{s} = \sqrt{\pi*f*\mu_{c} / \sigma_{c}}$
$R' = \frac{R_{s}}{2\pi}(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b})$
$L' = \frac{\mu}{2\pi}ln(b/a)$
$G' = \frac{2\pi\sigma}{ln(b/a)}$
$C' = \frac{2\pi\varepsilon}{ln(b/a)} = \frac{2\pi\varepsilon_{r}\varepsilon_{0}}{ln(b/a)}$
