#+title: Fleeting Notes
#+filetags: :Roam:

Meant to capture thoughts/tasks/ideas througout the day.

Meant for recording information in order to process it and refile/record it later.

*Fleeting notes are meant to be /thrown away/ after being processed*

In order for this to properly work, I can't leave fleeting notes in my system - I /HAVE/ to go back and put the content into permanent notes.
