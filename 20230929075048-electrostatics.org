$\nabla\cdot D=\rho_{v}\rightarrow$ Guass's law and Charge Density
$\nabla * E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}\rightarrow$ Faraday's Law
- Time rate of change in magnetic field (induces an electric field)

$\nabla\cdot B=0\rightarrow$ Gauss's law for magnetism (There are no single monopoles).
$\nabla * H=J+\frac{\partial D}{\partial t}\rightarrow$ Ampere's Law
- A current or time varying electric field causes a magnetic field

  E,D - electric field intensities (V/m), electric flux (C/m^2)
  H,B - Magnetic Field Intensity (A/m), magnetic flux intensity (T)
  $\rho_v$ - Charge/unit volume
  J - current density/area (amps/m^2)
  B - $\mu H$
  D - $\varepsilon E$
  $\mu$ - magnetic permeability


*NOTE*
Difference here between /statics/ and /dynamics/

In /statics/ $\partial / \partial t=0$
which means that
$$\nabla\cdot D=\rho_{p}$$
$\nabla*E=0$
$\nabla\cdot B=0$
$\nabla*H=J$

** Charge and Current Distributions

Clasically, when charge is moving, we have current
$i(t) = \frac{dq}{dt}=I$
with current density $I=\int_{s}J\cdot ds$
note that ds here represents area perpendicular to the flow of current.

*Convection Current* - When current is caused by actual movement of electrically charged matter in space.
*Conduction Current* - Current is caused by movement of charged particles from one atom to another.
                                      This is what happens in wires - the electrons leaving one end of the wire are not the same that entered.

 Later, we will see a third type, called *Displacement Current* - where there is no movement of charge.
 When we have a /time varying electric flux density/ we create a displacement current.
$I_{d} = \int_{s}\frac{\partial D}{\partial t}\cdot ds\rightarrow$ displacement current

This is how capacitors appear to conduct current, despite the dialectric between their terminals

** Coulomb's Law

Charge generates magnetic field.
Given a second charge, we have a force.

$E=\hat{R}\frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon R^{2}}(V/m)\rightarrow$ E field lines face outward. If we have another charge with charge of q, then force $F=qE$

$\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{r}\varepsilon_{0}$
$\varepsilon_0 = 8.85*10^{-12}$
$\varepsilon_{r}$ - relative permeability

** Gauss's Law

Relates electric field flux to charge

$\nabla\cdot D = \rho_{v} \leftrightarrow \ointD\cdot ds = Q$

$\nabla\cdot D\rightarrow$ Divergence.
$\nabla=\hat{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\hat{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\hat{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$
Divergence is a measure of the flow vectors tendency to /diverge/ from that point (what point??)
If outward flux exceeds inward flux, we have positive divergence. If outward less than inward, negative divergence. Equal, zero divergence.

$\nabla\cdot E$ - measures how much the electric field lines diverge


*** What is Flux - $\phi$

$\phi =$ Field * Surface Area


$\phi_{E} =$ number of Electric Field Lines actually passing through a surface

Through a closed surface (what does this mean?)
$\phi_{E} = \oint_{s}E\cdot dA = \frac{q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_{0}}$


*Any electric charge produces an electric field*
The flux of that field passing through any closed surface is:
/proportional to the total charge contained within that surface/

Electric field - force generated
$E=\frac{F_e}{q_0}$


** Electric Scalar Potential
[[id:16677255-00cb-44d8-b159-d77192a4925d][Voltage]] - voltage potential, also known as electromotive force (EMF)

Given that $F=-qE$ and W=distance*force -> $dW=F_{ext}\cdot dl=-qE\cdot dl$

The differential potential energy per unit charge - differential electric potential or differential voltage
$dv=\frac{dW}{q}=-E\cdot dl (J/C) or Volts$
$V_{21}=V_{2}-V_{1}=-\int_{p1}^{p2}E\cdot dl \rightarrow\text{If the length is along x}\rightarrow V=E_{x}l$
and $I=\int_{A}J\cdot ds=\int_{A}\sigma E\cdot ds$

** Conuctors

[[id:62f4c08c-744e-4c97-8a5f-80c1dbbb74f2][Conductivity]]

Conductors and dialectrics (insulators).
Some materials often considered insulators can conduct.
Conductors have a large number of loosely attached electrons.
In the absence of an electric field, these move in random directions, but inside a field we have a conduction current.
$J=\sigma E(A/m^{s})$ where $\sigma$ is conductivity

With this definition, DC resistance becomes:
$R=\frac{l}{\sigma A}=\rho l/A$
This is different from what we discussed in chapter 2:
$R'=\frac{R_{s}}{2\pi a}$ where $R_{s}=\sqrt{\pi f\mu_{c}/\sigma_{c}}$
When a wire is carrying an AC signal, the conductor has a surface resistance $R_s$

Thus:
DC resistance: $R=\frac{l}{\sigma A}$
AC resistance: $R'=\frac{R_{s}}{2\pi a}$ where $R_{s}=\sqrt{\pi f\mu_{c}/\sigma_{c}}\rightarrow R_{ac}=R'*length$

** Joules Law

[[id:3d6f8078-0a14-45b1-9b41-405530daa033][Joule's Law]]
$P=I^{2}R=V^{2}/R=VI$

** Dielectrics
In conductors, outer electrons are bound weakly to the atom - free to migrate.
In dielectrics, outer electrons tightly bound.

*Dielectric Breakdown*
So far, we've assumed that electric field does not exceed some critical value (called dielectric strength $E_{ds}$)
If $E>E_{ds}$ then electrons begin to detach from the molecules and move through the material as conduction current.
This is known as dielectric breakdown - damage usually permanent.

Dielectric strength is a function of the material, temperature, frequency, humidity, etc.

** Capacitance

In any 2 conductor arrangement
$C=\frac{Q}{V}\rightarrow C=\frac{\int_{s}{\varepsilon E\cdot ds}}{-\int_{l}E\cdot dl}$

Parallel Plate: $C=\frac{\varepsilon A}{l}$
Coax: $C=\frac{2\pi\varepsilon}{ln(b/a)}$
