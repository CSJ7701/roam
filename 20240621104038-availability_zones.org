#+title: Availability Zones

A term used by [[id:b1a8d451-fc98-409f-9287-9d56d8696495][Microsoft Azure]] to describe seperated groups of data centers within a region. They are close enough together to have low-latency connections to other zones; connected together with a round-trip latency of less than 2 milliseconds. They are spaced far enough apart to reduce the likelihood of some natural event compromising more than one - such as power failure, fire, etc. Each zone has independent power, cooling, networking, etc.
