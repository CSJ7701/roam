In mechanical systems, a spring is analogous to a capacitor, mass to an inductor, and a damper to a resistor.  
We begin be using the relationships in the table to rewrite mechanical components into a transfer function.

The sum of forces written in terms of velocity in a translational mechanical system is equivalent to the sum of voltages in terms of current in an electrical one.

We can find the sum of forces using the equation $F(s)=Z_{m}(s)*X(s)$ where each component is written in the laplace domain. F(s) represents the forces, and Z(s) represents the transfer function that we create from the components, in terms of their impedance.
