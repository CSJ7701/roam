** SUMMER TRAINING LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK

Excitement:
   Given an opportunity to influence an entire class of incoming cadets. I'm able to set the stage for their development and growth - both as people and as officers.
Nervous:
   The responsibility that comes with that opportunity and influence. I'm worried about messing up and either setting a poor example or failing to develop them in the correct ways.

Class Rules:
- Respect Others
- Judgement Free
- Understanding/Empathetic
- Open/Inclusive
- Positive Attitude
- Active participation

What does it mean to be a leader of character?
- Setting the example at all times
- Constant engagement
- Goal oriented/Purposeful
- Appropriate Energy
- Looking for help where needed
- Practice what we preach
- Balanced Relationship
- Upholding Core Values
- Safe and Helpful environment
- Authenticity
- HUMILITY!!! Authority doesn't mean shit.
  - A crown does not a king make; dunce in a golden cap.
- Open to Feedback
- Maintain Composure

The components to delivering a successful training:
- Have a clear goal
- Have well defined steps to reach that goal
- Different trainings require different objectives
- Keep the goal/purpose in mind
- Demonstrations are typically the most useful
- Making sure the entire group is on-board with the material being taught
- Repetition builds retention - along with other types of material reinforcement
  - Consult with the other cadre to accomodate everyone
- Making sure the trainees understand the goal behind the training
  - As much as is practical, sometimes you do have to say "Because I said so"
- Ensure consistant priorities among cadre
  - This is what the regs are for. Total adherance to the regulations
- Manage your reactions - you are always being watched


3 parts of an objective:
- Condition
  Tools, required items, specific situations/scenarios

- Performance
  Procedure or product, proper outcome

- Standard
  Within a given time, Accuracy, Procedural steps, etc

*** Laws of Learning
*Readiness*
- Present an effective learning environment
- Make sure they know they can ask questions in the right situations
- Ensure proper engagement, cadre set the tone
  - If there's lack of engagement, it's probably coming from a lack of engagement/intensity from the cadre.


*Intensity*
- The more excitement material creates, the more likely to be remembered.
- Try to create hands on experiences or incite emotional responses from the trainees.

  
*Exercise*
- Practice makes perfect
- Ensure that repetition is a priority, you can't expect them to do something once and immediately understand it
  
  
*Primacy*
- Once you learn information, it's incredibly difficult to reteach it.
- As phase 2, we will have to adjust to what was taught during the first phase.
- Your first impression is what you take for the truth.

- Ensure proper communication between groups and among current group
- Get basis of understanding before beginning any instruction
- Make sure all information is communicated in a permanent fashion

- All cadre should have an understanding of every collateral.
- Make sure you maintain a proper continuum. If you start at 100, you have no where to go.

  
*Effect*
- Learning is strengthened when it's viewed positively. Create a positive environment around informational training
- Learning is weakened when its seen negatively. Try to avoid negative connotation around training (for example, don't phrase drill as a punishment)
- Learning happens *most* effectively when it results in satisfaction.

  
*Recency*
- We typically remember the most recent material covered.
- When teaching, we should build on previously covered material.
- All teaching should be incremental. 



*** Attention and Memory
Attention
- "Eyes"
- Verbally emphasize important pieces of information
- Vary your speech patterns - The same way you would with drill commands
- Engage the trainees - have them participate to some degree
  - This can involve having them repeat what you say, copy your movements, or popcorn the information
- Keep the trainees active (even if this isn't something you can participate in)
  - Have them move around during an evolution, basically keep them from falling asleep
- Cold-call when quizzing
- State the expectation - "If you don't know X, Y will happen"


Memory
- Make sure they can repeat or execute information/commands after it's been presented
- "Test" them on whatever we've just covered
- E.G. For drill commands, once I've taught it, have the group execute it. If there seems to be confusion, break it down either within the group or break down the information (seperate people, or teach the information piece by piece).
