In practice, signal sements will always be finite, however many datasets are not finite.

If we want to analyze a continuous/infinite dataset using the [[id:f9208e13-6c4c-4992-82bb-2e1a87e01040][Discrete Time Fourier Transform]], we need the signal to be finite.

We /could/ take some segment that we want to analyze of the signal, and repeat that segment in order to make it periodic.
If we did that, we have essentially created infinite discontinuities wherever each segment joins.

We refer to these "segments" as _Windows_.

For a window containing signal $x(n)$, our window is $\hat{x(n)}=x(n)w(n)$ where $w(n)=u(n)-u(n-N-1)$, N is the number of points.
This is known as a _Rectangular Window_
