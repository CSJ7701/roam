* GUI
Controlled by buttons, checkboxes, etc
"Message pump" that waits for events, etc

Touch input, interact with genstures etc

* CLI
Commands and command interpreters. Bash is an example of a command interpreter. 

CLI is typically the only way to interact with things like headless servers. 
It's generally faster, and it's almost always more powerful/more adaptable than the GUI.
