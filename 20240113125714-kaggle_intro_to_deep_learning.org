* Neurons

Deep Learning - an approach to machine learning characterized by deep stacks of computations..
This depth is what enable deep learning models to disentangle and interpret complex and hierarchical problems.

Nerual Networks are recognized as the defining model of deep learning. They are composed of *Neurons*, where each neuron performs a single computation.
Neurons, or /units/, with one input are defined by the equation $y=wx+b$, where the input is x. Its connection to the neuron has a multiplicative weight /w/.
A neuron learns by modifying the weights attached to each neuron. /b/ represents the neurons bias - which is an additive constant that allows the neuron to modify its output independent of its input.
