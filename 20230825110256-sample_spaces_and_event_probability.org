#+title: Sample Spaces and Event Probability
#+filetags: :ProbTheory:


- Experiment
  The process of observation or measurement
  ex - roll a dice, etc
- Outcome
  The result from the experiment
  ex - gets a 4, 5, etc
- Sample Space
  The set of all possible outcomes
  ex - S{1,2,3,4,5,6}
- Event
  A subset of the sample space (we get a specific scenario)
  ex - a prime number is rolled


* Sample Space
Discrete - finite or countably infinite
Continuous - consists of a continuum

* Probability of an event
A = event A
P(A) = probability of event A

When S is discrete (the sample space):
1. $P(A)\ge0$
2. $P(S)=1$
3. If $A_{1}, A_{2}...$ is a finite or infinite sequence of events which are mutually exclusive.



* Ex - Equally likely outcomes
Flip a coin 3 times
$S=\{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT\}$
A = event you get 2 or 3 heads = $\{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH\}$
$P(A) = \frac{4}{8}$

5 card poker hand
Num of possible hands - $\binom{52}{5}$
P(3 of a kind and a pair)
3 of a kind - face ; pair - face

13 cards per suit
4 suits, 4 of each face

$\binom{13}{1}$ - number of faces you can draw
$binom{4}{3}$ - chance of drawing the same face 3 times
$\binom{12}{1}$ - chance of drawing a different face
$\binom{4}{2}$ - chance of drawing the same face twice

those are out of the total choices, so:
$\frac{\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{3}\binom{12}{1}\binom{4}{2}}{\binom{52}{5}}$

---

P(4 of a kind) and one of something else

$\binom{13}{1}$ - number of face you can choose
$\binom{4}{4}$ - chance of drawing the same face 4 times
$\binom{12}{1}$ - chance to draw a new face.
$\binom{4}{1}$ - Draw one card out of four from the new face
 Those out of total choices:
 $\frac{\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{4}\binom{12}{1}\binom{4}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}}$

---

P(2 pairs and a different card)

$\binom{13}{2}$ - number of faces you can draw, but we're choosing 2 faces
$\binom{4}{2}$ - Chance of drawing 2 of the same face, for one face
$\binom{4}{2}$ - Chance of drawing 2 of the same face, for the other face
$\binom{11}{1}$ - chance of drawing a different face
$\binom{4}{1}$ - choose one card from the new face
Those out of total choices:
$\frac{\binom{13}{2}\binom{4}{2}\binom{4}{2}\binom{11}{1}\binom{4}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}}$

---

P(3 of a kind and 2 different)

$\binom{13}{1}$ - number of faces you can draw
$\binom{4}{3}$ - 3 from the same face
$\binom{12}{2}$ - number of available faces, but we're picking 2
$\binom{4}{1}$ - choose one card from one of the faces
$\binom{4}{1}$ - choose one card from the other face

Total:
$\frac{\binom{13}{1}\binom{4}{3}\binom{12}{2}\binom{4}{1}\binom{4}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}}$
