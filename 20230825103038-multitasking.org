#+title: Multitasking

This cycles tasks in a "round-robin" style, forcing older tasks out to make room for a new one on each repetition.
This schedules a certain wait time per process, and uses [[id:b6c45bfe-a167-440e-9cd0-2cd16a933088][Context Switching]] to divide resources between the processes. It prioritizes some processes over other, these priorities can be affected in windows with the task manager, and manually in linux.
