#+title: Transfer Functions of Gear Systems
#+filetags: :Controls:

Having discussed [[id:4f923bb5-8a2c-462b-bb5d-e6fb0838dd4a][Transfer Functions of Rotational Mechanical Systems]], we see that these types of systems are rarely present without gears of some form.
Gears provide mechanical advantage to rotational systems, adjusting both speed and torque based on the size ratio between the two gears.

The ratio between gears is calculated based on the number of teeth in each gear.
Since we know that two connected gears will rotate with the same angular velocity, we can say that $r_{1}\Theta_{1}=r_{2}\Theta_{2}$, and from this we derive the equation $\frac{\Theta_{2}}{\Theta_{1}}=\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}=\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}$



Since we assume the gears are lossless, we generalize the same relationship with torque - $\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}=\frac{\Theta_{1}}{\Theta_{2}}=\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}$
