Stability is the sum of [[id:602c3cc0-0013-46bd-b33a-88ecada1043e][Natural Response]] and [[id:41e76b0e-41cf-4a2b-9520-9c1ef0601065][Forced Response]]. 

In order to useful, natural response must either approach zero or oscillate. 
In some systems, the natural response grows without bound; a condition known as instability.
