#+title: Frequency in Continuous and Discrete time signals

Simple harmonic oscillation can be represented by:
$x_{a}(t)=Acos(\Omega t+\theta)$
$\Omega=2\pi F$

Sinusoids are periodic, with the fundamental period given by: $T_{p}=1/F$

We can describe these sinusoids with complex exponential functions
$x_{a}(t)=Ae^{j(\Omega t+\theta)}$
This can be applied to the generic formula:
$x_{a}(t)=Acos(\Omega t+\theta)=\frac{A}{2}e^{j(\Omega t+\theta)}+\frac{A}{2}e^{-j(\Omega t+\theta)}$



This is slightly different for discrete time signals
$x(n)=Acos(\omega n+\theta)$ where again, $\omega=2\pi f$

Discrete time sinusoids are periodic only if their frequency is a rational number.
If periodic, the fundamental period can be represented by: $f_{0}=\frac{k}{N}$

Discrete time signals whose frequencies are seperated by an integer multiple of $2\pi$ are identical.

The highest rate of oscilation that a DT sinusoid can achieve occurs when $\omega=\pi$ or $\omega=-\pi$
