#+title: Transfer Function
#+filetags: :Controls:DSP:SST:

Transfer Functions represent a system, and are characterized by the function $G(s)=\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}$, where C is the output and R is the input.
Transfer functions are evaluated with initial conditions of 0. 

Transfer Functions can be represented as block diagrams, with input on the left and output on the right. 

Transfer functions are especially useful when representing physical systems. These can either be [[id:db0db8b3-7e0c-436d-840d-910a8d7058c8][Electrical Systems]] or mechanical.
