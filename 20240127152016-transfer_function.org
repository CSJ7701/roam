#+title: Transfer Function
#+filetags: :Controls:DSP:SST:

Transfer Functions represent a system, and are characterized by the function $G(s)=\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}$, where C is the output and R is the input.
Transfer functions are evaluated with initial conditions of 0. 

Transfer Functions can be represented as block diagrams, with input on the left and output on the right.
