#+title: Intro to Discrete Mathematics
#+filetags: :Discrete:

Discrete mathematics is inherently /Discrete/.
- There is a countably finite sample space for everything we will cover
- This is in contrast to calculus, where our focus was on continuous space over the set of all reals.

Ex.
Discrete - the number of cadets in this class
Continuous - The temperature in S136 during the 0900-0950 block

Within the discrete space, most of our time is spent /counting/, vs the continuous space, where we focus more on /measuring/.

This class is also based on /intuition/.
In classes like calculus, we have a given number of ways to solve the equation 

$sec^{2}(x)tan(x)dx$.
In this class, we will focus on more qualitative methods to solve problems like:

How many integers are there between 1 and $\binom{100}{n}$  inclusive?
