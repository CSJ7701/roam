#+title: Independent Probabilities
#+filetags: :ProbTheory:

An event is independent if its outcome does not depend on other events. 

Definition:
A and B are independent if $P(B|A) = P(B)$ OR $P(A|B) = P(A)$

For an independent event:
$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(B\cap A)}{P(A)} = P(B)$$

If A and B are independent then A' and B' are also independent.
-> $$P(A\cap B') = P(A)*P(B)$$

*Independence of more than 2 events*
Events $A_1, A_2, A_3, ...$ are independent if the product of the intersection of any 2,3,...,k of them equals the product of their probabilities.

You must find the probability of each combination of the possibilities.
Given $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$
We must find all 6 combinations of 2, both combinations of 3, and the combination of 4.
