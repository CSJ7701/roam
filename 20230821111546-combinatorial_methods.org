Ex - Order a book online
3 books, 2 credit cards, 4 shipping options
Num of ways to order -> 3*2*4 = 24

Ex - Test with 50 q's
1-20 T/F
21-50 5 options, choose 1
Num of ways to answer the questions? -> $2^{20} * 5^{30}$

Theorem:
If an operation consists of K steps,
1st $n_1$ ways, 2nd $n_2$ ways, kth $n_k$ ways.
Num of ways to do an operation = $n_{1}*n_{2}*...*n_{k}$
