#+title: Overtaking
#+filetags: :MWO:

Approach from 22.5 degrees abaft of beam.
Sternlight is the /only/ visible light.

If in doubt, assume you are overtaking

There is no action that can make it a crossing situation - i.e. once you begin overtaking someone, you obligate yourself to be the give-way vessel.
NOTHING relieves the overtaking vessel from their obligation to keep clear.
