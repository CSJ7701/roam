#+title: Maximizing Transmitter to an Antenna
#+filetags: :Antennas:


* Example Problem
** Assumptions
All impedances are /pure resistances/ - no reactive or imaginary component
When load impedance is real and the same as the source impedance, max power is delivered to a load.
Transmitter can be represented as a voltage source /w internal impedance $Z_{s} = 50\Omega$
Antenna can be represented a load impedance $Z_{L}$

When we have reactive loads, we can help cancel out the reactance with the opposite element. For example, in the instance above, we could add a capacitor in series with the inductor, giving the capacitor a capacitance of $-j100$ which will cancel with the inductance of $+j100$. This is known as adding a matching Network.
