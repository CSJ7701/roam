#+title: Writing a Shell Script
#+filetags: :OS:

Create a shell script/Run it
Add it to path

Needs execute permissions (chmod u+x filename) (chmod +x filename)

Adding to path:
Add the root folder to $PATH.
Best way to add random programs to the path is to add them to the /usr/local/bin directory.
The next best option is to create your own folder (scripts, for example) and add it to the path.
