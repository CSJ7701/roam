#+title: Analog and Digital Signals
#+filetags: :DSP:

Most practical signals are analog.
We convert them to digital so that we can better interact with them.

We take an analog input, convert to a digital signal, use our /system/ to interact with that signal, convert it back to analog, then output that analog signal.

Systems perform operations on signals, and can be physical or logical.

Analog systems (linear circuits) can be intractable and imprecise. Digital systems are much easier to work with.

* Types of signals
- Continuous vs. Discrete
- Deterministic vs. Random
- Analog vs. Digital


It' important to recognise whether a signal is [[id:ebee6a91-9556-4bb6-abc9-98f27fd664a2][Periodic]] or not.
