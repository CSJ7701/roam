Structural Models display the organization of a system in terms of the components that make up the system and their relationships. These are a type of [[id:67b49bb0-5ed4-4f37-a5bd-e8d291fd1eb8][UML]] model.
These are particularly useful when organizing and designing system architecture. The most common structural model is the [[id:41e6c4ca-5f0f-416a-a583-896689e857d9][Class Diagram]], which is primarily what we will be discussing.
