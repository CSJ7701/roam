#+title: Bode Plots
#+filetags: :Linear:

Bode Plots are used to plot frequency response (Magnitude and Phase) for continuous transfer functions.

We can approximate the effects from real poles and zeros using straight line asymptotes with a log (or dB) magnitude vs log frequency plots, and phase vs log frequency plots. *These* are bode plots.

We will study Bode plots based on the "building blocks" of a transfer function:
1. a constant multiple C
2. real poles or zeros of the form $(s+a)^N$
3. Poles or zeros at the origin, $s^N$
4. and complex poles or zeros of the form $(s^{2}+\frac{\omega_{0}s}{Q}+\omega_{0}^{2})^N$

   where N represents a non-zero integer.


We can represent more complicated systems (typically products of such building blocks):
$$H(s) = H_{1}(s)H_{2}(s)H_{3}(s)$$
The frequency response can be represented in terms of magnitude and phase:
$$|H(j\omega)| = |H_{1}(j\omega)|*|H_{2}(j\omega)|*|H_{3}(j\omega)|...$$
$$\angle H(j\omega) = \angle H_{1}(j\omega) + \angle H_{2}(j\omega) ...$$

In dB, these can both add.


We can use the first building block - C, a constant multiple. 
We can represent its magnitude in terms of the log functions we've already studied:
$|H(j\omega)_{\text{dB}} = 20 log_{10}(|C|)$
Its phase is either 0 (if C is positive) or $\pm 180$ degrees ($\pm\pi$ radians) if C is negative.

* Example - Real Pole
$H(s) = \frac{1}{s+1}$
Here there is a pole at $s=-1$.
We can find frequency response by evaluating along the $j\omega$ axis:
$H(j\omega) = \frac{1}{j\omega+1}$
and the magnitude response with:
$H(j\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\omega^{2}}}$

When $\omega << 1$, $|H(j\omega)|$ is about 1.
When $\omega >> 1$, $|H(j\omega)|$ is about $\frac{1}{\omega}$.

We can approximate this relationship:
$|H(j\omega)|\approx|C|\omega^{k}$
In the above example, C=1 and k=0 for $\omega << 1$, k=-1 for $\omega >> 1$.
We can take the log of both sides of this relationship:
$log_{10}(|H(j\omega)|)\approx log_{10}(|C|)+k log_{10}(\omega)$
Which shows that a plot of $log_{10}(|H(j\omega)|)$ vs $log(\omega)$ can be approximated with a straight line of slope k.

Now we start actually plotting.
Remember that when $\omega <<1$, C=1 and k=0.
When $\omega >> 1$, C=1 and k=-1

We can calculate the slope of the second half of the graph with:
$20log_{10}(|H(j\omega)|)\approx 20log_{10}(1) - 20log_{10}(\omega)$
which equals:
$20log_{10}(|H(j\omega)|)\approx -20log_{10}(\omega)$
This represents a -20dB per decade decay. Our asymptote is one (this is $\omega$).
