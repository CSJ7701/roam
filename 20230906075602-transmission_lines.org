#+title: Transmission Lines
#+filetags: :Antennas:

Transmission Lines connect the transmitter and receiver to the antenna.

Characteristic Imedance, Length, Loss per Meter, Balanced vs. Unbalanced, and Velocity Factor.

Elements are considered Transmission Lines once they are [[id:57bc23bc-8422-4f06-8b03-1aa088254166][Parasitic Elements]]. 
That is, length is > 0.01*Wavelength.

There are many types of transmission lines:

All mediums attenuate their signals, and this is true for transmission lines.
Attenuation is known as loss. In general, larger diameter leads to /lower/ levels of loss. 

Power loss: dB per unit length: $L_{dB}=\alpha * l$ where $\alpha$ = loss coefficient in dB\km and l is length.
Output Power: $P_{out} = P_{in}*\frac{1}{L_{Linear}}$
$L_{Linear}$: $10^{\frac{L_{dB}}{10}}$

As a medium absorbs power/energy etc, the signal will slow.
$u_{p}$ - velocity of the wave
c - speed of light
vf - velocity factor (how much the wave is slowed as it travels

$u_{p} = vf*c$ and $\lambda = \frac{u_{p}}{f}$
