#+title: Container

Virtualization Environment, similar to [[id:61d1153b-3d2a-4e72-babc-1969c1849005][Virtual Machine]]s.
Unlike virtual machines, containers are not an instance of an operating system that you can log into and manage directly.
Containers are instead meant as headless instances that run independently.
